# Bitwise Operators
- C has 6 bit operators
-  They consist of:

Symbol | Name |
---|---|
&|Bitwise AND|
\| Bitwise inclusive OR|
^|Bitwise exlusive OR|
<<|left shift|
Right shift|
~| Ones compliment

- They can be applied to char, short, int, long, signed or unsigned
## The Bitwise "&" operator to mask some of the bits.
- A mask determines which bits we want to keep and which bits we want to clear off a binary number
- Ex: n = n & 0177;
- Means that it sets to 0 except for the low-order 7 bits of n
## The Bitwise OR operator turns the bits on
- Ex: x = x | SET_ON;
- This sets the bits in x to on, the ones that are set to 1 in SET_ON
##  Exclusive OR operator puts a 1 in each bit position where the operands have differnt bits and 0 where they are the same
## left and right operands
- shift operand perform left and right shifts of their left operand by the number of bit positions given by the right operand which has to be positive
- Ex: x << 2; shifts the value of x left 2 positions and fills the vacated bits with 0s
##  ~ operator
- converts each 1 bit into 0 and vice versa
