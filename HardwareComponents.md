# Defining Terms

- CRT, VDT, CON, TTY = Terminal

# The Computer Operator

- CP/M, you are able to name program and call them by their specfic name
- Subspecies- computer users and computer programmers
- It is important to name your projects the correct name, that way you won't forget how to use your own program

## hardware of computer

- Include small microcomputer system

# Operators Console

- Earliest computers made of rows and rows of light, swithces and patch cords
- ASR-33 became the standard of minicomputer industry (computer operator console)
- TTY allowed for people to look at the paper and see their mistakes

# The Computer

- Human operators are the ones communicating with the computer
- Each computer has a central processing unit (cpu)
- The CPU is what does the manipulations in the system

# The 8080 and its Relatives

- CPU
- 8080 executed enough instructions to be useful and programmable
- 8080 is slow, required 3 different power supply voltages, and needed extra ICs to provide clocks and the system control
- 8085 = +5 volt DC power supply, easier to run because more simple hardware

# Instructions In Memory

- Operations and code we tell the computers to perform will be stored in memory
- The CPU later takes them from memory to perform the assignment
- 8080 format is bytes
- ROM = = Read only memory
- PROM = programmable read-only memory
- RAM = random access memory
- EPROM = Erasable PROM

# Mass Storage

- 8080 family of micros can address 65,536 bytes of memory
- Mass storage is any type of external memory: Tapes, Disks, Drums, or RAM when it is being used outside of the main memory address space.
- CP/M has two floppy disk drives for mass storage

# Disk Addressing

- Data on disks is recorded on circular tracks
- Each sector has its own address
- CP/M has 128 bytes

# Hard Copy

- Decwriter print one character at a time
- A line printer recieves character and stores them in a buffer until it receives a termination character

# Other Peripherals

- Operators Console, CPU, Memory, hard copy device our CP/M is ready to use!
- Other peripherals such as floppy disks can be used
- For an additional input device, the old standby in paper tape reader which is used with the paper tape punch

# A simple Computer System

- Assembly language programming will be used
